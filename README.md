# Instructions for my_project 'Todo App'
App runs on localhost and uses mongoose database on default port. Also, 'my_project/public/' folder contains built version of client side so installing node packages and runnin nodemon in my_project folder should start the app on localhost:3000.

Todo app requires authentication, so user must register and login in order to have access to the todos. In 'Todos' page, user can post new tasks that have title, description, and the logged user is automatically assigned to the task. If other user updates the tasks status, that user will be assigned to it. 

Home page keeps track on how many tasks are completed or needs action.
